# Farmers Insurance - MySQL Case Study
## 🧾 Executive Summary

The **Farmers Insurance Analysis** project is a collaborative data exploration initiative focused on analyzing and understanding the agricultural insurance landscape in India. Using structured data sourced from multiple regions and years, this project aims to derive insights into crop insurance coverage, premium distribution, farmer demographics, and regional insurance trends.

We built the project around a comprehensive SQL-driven workflow, powered by **MySQL Workbench**. The dataset was structured into relational tables — including `states`, `districts`, and `farmersinsurancedata` — to normalize the data and enable efficient querying. The team leveraged core SQL skills along with advanced techniques like **window functions**, **subqueries**, and **data integrity constraints** to solve more than 25 case-based questions.

The project was executed collaboratively by three team members — **Deepak**, **Kripa**, and **Sravan** — who divided tasks based on SQL competencies. The final outcome includes not only fully solved SQL queries but also a robust ER diagram and schema design, complete with foreign key relationships and normalization.

### 🎯 Key Deliverables:
- ✅ SQL case study covering filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions
- ✅ A normalized relational schema with foreign key enforcement
- ✅ Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram visualized using dbdiagram.io
- ✅ GitHub collaboration with individual development branches
- ✅ Final report and code submission aligned with academic standards

### 🔍 Insights Uncovered:
- Yearly trends in insured farmers and land coverage
- Premium contribution analysis by farmers, states, and government
- District-wise risk profiling and demographic coverage
- Identification of underperforming or low-insured regions

This project not only demonstrated strong technical SQL capabilities, but also showcased the team's ability to collaborate effectively, work with real-world data, and derive actionable insights for data-driven decision making in the agri-insurance domain.
