# Farmers Insurance - MySQL Case Study
## 🧾 Executive Summary

The **Farmers Insurance Analysis** project is a collaborative data exploration initiative focused on analyzing and understanding the agricultural insurance landscape in India. Using structured data sourced from multiple regions and years, this project aims to derive insights into crop insurance coverage, premium distribution, farmer demographics, and regional insurance trends.

We built the project around a comprehensive SQL-driven workflow, powered by **MySQL Workbench**. The dataset was structured into relational tables — including `states`, `districts`, and `farmersinsurancedata` — to normalize the data and enable efficient querying. The team leveraged core SQL skills along with advanced techniques like **window functions**, **subqueries**, and **data integrity constraints** to solve more than 25 case-based questions.

The project was executed collaboratively by three team members — **Deepak**, **Kripa**, and **Sravan** — who divided tasks based on SQL competencies. The final outcome includes not only fully solved SQL queries but also a robust ER diagram and schema design, complete with foreign key relationships and normalization.

### 🎯 Key Deliverables:
- ✅ SQL case study covering filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions
- ✅ A normalized relational schema with foreign key enforcement
- ✅ Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
- ✅ GitHub collaboration with individual development branches
- ✅ Final report and code submission aligned with academic standards

### 🔍 Insights Uncovered:
- Yearly trends in insured farmers and land coverage
- Premium contribution analysis by farmers, states, and government
- District-wise risk profiling and demographic coverage
- Identification of underperforming or low-insured regions

This project not only demonstrated strong technical SQL capabilities, but also showcased the team's ability to collaborate effectively, work with real-world data, and derive actionable insights for data-driven decision making in the agri-insurance domain.

**Conclusion**
The Farmers Insurance MySQL Case Study provided a comprehensive platform to apply structured query language (SQL) to a real-world dataset representing India's agricultural insurance sector. Through a well-organized relational schema and strategically crafted SQL queries, we uncovered meaningful insights into state-wise and district-level insurance patterns, premium contributions, and population demographics.

This project not only reinforced fundamental SQL skills such as filtering, aggregation, and joins, but also challenged the team with advanced concepts including subqueries, window functions, and data normalization techniques. Our findings highlighted disparities in insurance coverage, revealed high-risk or under-insured regions, and traced financial trends across different years and stakeholders.

Collaborating as a team of three — Deepak, Kripa, and Sravan — we ensured code quality, shared learning, and effective division of tasks. The finalized ER diagram, normalized schema, and robust query library reflect both technical rigor and real-world relevance. Overall, this case study stands as a strong demonstration of how data can drive smarter decision-making in critical domains like agriculture and public insurance policy.
